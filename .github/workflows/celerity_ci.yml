# We currently run this workflow on three different triggers,
# which all have subtly different semantics.
on:
  # Run workflow on any push to any branch.
  push:
  # Also run on internal PRs. The difference to the "push" trigger
  # being, that the workflow will run on the result of merging the PR's
  # commits into the target branch.
  pull_request:
    branches-ignore:
      # Ignore branches from forks (which contain a colon).
      - '**:**'
  # Finally, also run on external PRs. By using the "_target" trigger,
  # we can ensure that the workflow definition itself will always come
  # from the main repository, not the fork (for security reasons).
  pull_request_target:
    branches:
      # Only consider branches from forks (which contain a colon).
      - '**:**'
