Celerity can be built and installed from
[source](https://github.com/celerity/celerity-runtime) using
[CMake](https://cmake.org). It requires the following dependencies:

- A C++20 compiler
- A supported SYCL implementation (see below)
- [*optional*] An MPI 2 implementation (for example [OpenMPI 4](https://www.open-mpi.org))

Note that while Celerity does support compilation and execution on Windows in
principle, in this documentation we focus exclusively on Linux, as it
represents the de-facto standard in HPC nowadays.

## Picking a SYCL Implementation

Celerity currently supports three different SYCL implementations. If you're
simply giving Celerity a try, the choice does not matter all that much. For
more advanced use cases or specific hardware setups it might however make
sense to prefer one over the other.

### AdaptiveCpp

[AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp) is an open source SYCL
and C++ standard parallelism implementation focused on leveraging existing toolchains
such as CUDA or HIP, making it a great choice when directly targeting Nvidia CUDA
and AMD ROCm platforms.

> AdaptiveCpp is currently available on Linux and has experimental/partial support
> for OSX and Windows.

### DPC++

Intel's LLVM fork [DPC++](https://github.com/intel/llvm) brings SYCL to the
latest Intel CPU and GPU hardware and also, experimentally, to CUDA and HIP
devices. Celerity will automatically detect when `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` points to
a DPC++ Clang.

To launch kernels on Intel GPUs, you will also need to install a recent version of the
[Intel Compute Runtime](https://github.com/intel/compute-runtime/releases) (failing to do so will
result in mysterious segfaults in the DPC++ SYCL library!)

> Celerity works with DPC++ on Linux.

### SimSYCL

[SimSYCL](https://github.com/celerity/SimSYCL) is a SYCL implementation that
is focused on development and verification of SYCL applications. Performance
is not a goal, and only CPUs are supported. It is a great choice for developing,
debugging, and testing your Celerity applications on small data sets.

Until its discontinuation in July 2023, Celerity also supported ComputeCpp as a SYCL implementation.

## Configuring Your Build

After installing all of the aforementioned dependencies, clone (we recommend
using `git clone --recurse-submodules`) or download
the [Celerity source files](https://github.com/celerity/celerity-runtime) from GitHub. Next, create
a `build` folder inside the Celerity root folder and navigate into it.

The exact CMake configuration call you need depends on a few factors, for example the SYCL
implementation you chose, as well as your target hardware
platform. Here are a couple of examples:

<!--DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

<!-- AdaptiveCpp + Ninja -->

```
cmake -G Ninja .. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<path-to-acpp-install>" -DACPP_TARGETS="cuda:sm_52" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<install-path>" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

<!-- DPC++ + Unix Makefiles-->

```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/path/to/dpc++/bin/clang++" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<install-path>" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

In case multiple SYCL implementations are in CMake's search path, you can disambiguate them
using `-DCELERITY_SYCL_IMPL=AdaptiveCpp|DPC++|SimSYCL`.

Note that the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` parameter should only be required if you
installed SYCL in a non-standard location. See the [CMake
documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) as well as the documentation
for your SYCL implementation for more information on the other parameters.

### Additional Configuration Options

The following additional CMake options are available:
| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CELERITY_ACCESS_PATTERN_DIAGNOSTICS | `BOOL` | Diagnose uninitialized reads and overlapping writes (default: `ON` for debug builds, `OFF` for release builds) |
| CELERITY_ACCESSOR_BOUNDARY_CHECK | `BOOL` | Enable boundary checks for accessors (default: `ON` for debug builds, `OFF` for release builds) |
| CELERITY_BUILD_EXAMPLES | `BOOL` | Build the example applications (default: `ON`) |
| CELERITY_ENABLE_MPI | `BOOL` | Enable MPI support (default: `ON`) |
| CELERITY_TRACY_SUPPORT | `BOOL` | Enable [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) support. See [Configuration](configuration.md) for runtime options. (default: `OFF`) |
| CELERITY_USE_MIMALLOC | `BOOL` | Use the [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) memory allocator (default: `ON`) |

## Building and Installing

After you have successfully configured CMake, building and installing
Celerity should be as simple as calling `ninja install` or `make install`.

If you just want to run the examples, you can skip the installation and
simply call `ninja` or `make`.

## Running Examples

If you have configured CMake to build the Celerity example applications, you
can now run them from within the build directory. For example, try running:

```
./examples/matmul/matmul
```

> **Tip:** You might also want to try and run the unit tests that come with Celerity.
> To do so, simply run `ninja test` or `make test`.

## Runtime Configuration

Celerity comes with a number of runtime configuration options that can be
set via environment variables. Learn more about them [here](configuration.md).

## Bootstrap your own Application

All projects in the `examples/` directory are stand-alone Celerity programs
â€“ if you like a template for getting started, just copy one of them to
bootstrap on your own Celerity application. You can find out more about that
[here](https://github.com/celerity/celerity-runtime/blob/master/examples).
